## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-13

### Added

- **Major Refactoring for Improved Maintainability**:
  - Created 8 new focused modules to better organize the codebase:
    - `constants.py`: Centralized configuration constants
    - `patterns.py`: Regex patterns for parsing
    - `errors.py`: Custom exception classes with factory methods
    - `env_loader.py`: Environment file handling logic
    - `include_handler.py`: TOML include directive processing
    - `parser.py`: TOML parsing and substitution logic
    - `cli.py`: CLI command logic
    - `converters.py`: Type conversion methods

- **CLI Render Command**: New `render` command for outputting resolved configuration as JSON
  - Processes TOML files with full environment variable substitution and include resolution
  - Outputs pretty-formatted JSON with 2-space indentation for readability
  - Useful for debugging configuration resolution and integration with other tools
  - Supports same arguments as `validate` command for consistency

- **CLI Version Support**: Added `-V/--version` flag to display current version
  - Works from any CLI context for quick version checking
  - Centralized version management through constants module

- **Include Directive Support**: New `__include` feature for composing TOML configurations from multiple files
  - Supports single file: `__include = "file.toml"`
  - Supports multiple files: `__include = ["file1.toml", "file2.toml"]`
  - Recursive include resolution with cycle detection
  - Relative path resolution from parent TOML file
  - Deep merge of included configurations
  - Caching of included files for performance

- **Enhanced Error Handling**:
  - New specialized exception classes: `EnvironmentVariableError`, `IncludeError`, `TypeConversionError`
  - Factory methods for common error scenarios
  - Better error messages with more context

- **Improved Test Coverage and Organization**:
  - New test module `test_include_feature.py` for include directive testing
  - Decoupled monolithic test file into focused modules:
    - `test_type_conversions.py`: Union, Optional, nested model, and literal type tests
    - `test_core_features.py`: Raw config access and dollar escape tests
    - `test_env_file_parsing.py`: Advanced .env file parsing edge cases
    - `test_cli_commands.py`: CLI validate and render command tests
  - Additional edge case coverage with maintained 90%+ test coverage

### Enhanced

- **Code Organization**:
  - Reduced `__main__.py` from 549 to 181 lines (-67%)
  - Reduced `__model__.py` from 389 to 169 lines (-57%)
  - Better separation of concerns with single-responsibility modules
  - Improved import structure and dependency management
  - Reorganized test suite into focused, maintainable modules for better discoverability

- **Type Safety**:
  - Better handling of `typing.Any` in generic collections
  - Enhanced type conversion for complex nested structures
  - Improved Union and Optional type handling

- **Performance**:
  - Include file caching to avoid redundant parsing
  - Optimized pattern matching in type conversions

### Fixed

- Fixed `TypeError` when handling `list[dict[str, Any]]` with mixed item types
- Corrected type conversion issues with `typing.Any` instantiation
- Resolved import ordering and unused import issues

### Changed

- Modularized codebase structure for better maintainability
- Moved type conversion logic to dedicated `converters.py` module
- Separated CLI functionality into `cli.py` module
- Extracted environment file handling to `env_loader.py`

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-09

### Fixed

- **Breaking**: Error handling now uses `ConfigValidationError` instead of `ValueError` for configuration validation
  errors
- Undefined environment variable errors in strict mode now raise appropriate `ConfigValidationError`
- Consistent exception handling across the entire codebase for configuration-related errors

### Added

- New test case `test_undefined_variable_raises_config_validation_error` to ensure proper exception handling
- Multi-platform quality checks now run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS in CI/CD pipeline
- Comprehensive workflow documentation with detailed job descriptions and dependency explanations
- TDD (Test-Driven Development) workflow documentation
- Comprehensive quality check enforcement in development workflow

### Enhanced

- **CI/CD Pipeline Improvements**:
    - Mandatory quality gates with `continue-on-error: false` on all critical steps
    - Quality checks achieve 100% success rate requirement before deployment
    - Cross-platform cache handling for Windows vs Unix systems
    - Enhanced job dependencies ensuring no deployment without quality validation
    - Improved workflow structure with clear documentation and failure handling
- Better error messages and validation consistency throughout the library
- Test coverage for edge cases in strict mode validation

### Changed

- GitHub Actions workflow now enforces mandatory quality checks across all platforms
- Quality checks must pass on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS before package building
- CI/CD pipeline structure enhanced with explicit job dependencies and failure conditions
- Development workflow now mandates running `uv run scripts/quality_check.py` after any code changes
- Enhanced development guidelines with mandatory quality assurance requirements
